# Monocular_Depth_Estimation_Project

I worked on a research internship project at BART Lab that aims to determine the length of a three dimensional object using a camera, OpenCV and Machine Learning. The focus is developing a medical robotics Computer Vision software using two main methodologies, one a Machine Learning Linear Regression model and the other is the use of the distance-pixel ratio parameter along with a camera calibration function, with the aim of accurately determining the length of an object regardless of altitude.

I wrote a research paper that describes the background research on this topic. It also provides details on the implementation and results of my project. The research project is among the files in this repository. It is Real_Time_Camera_Depth_Estimation pdf.
