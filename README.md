# Monocular_Depth_Estimation_Project

I worked on a research internship project at BART Lab that aims to determine the length of a three dimensional object using a camera, OpenCV and Machine Learning. The focus is developing a medical robotics Computer Vision software using two main methodologies, one a Machine Learning Linear Regression model and the other is the use of the distance-pixel ratio parameter along with a camera calibration function, with the aim of accurately determining the length of an object regardless of altitude.

I wrote a research paper that describes the background research on this topic and also provides details on the implementation and results of my project.
